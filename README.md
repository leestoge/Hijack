A lone survivor of a team of super soldiers, The Hackermen, are sent in to (SUPERCOMPUTERS NAME) inner mainframe to try and regain control and stop it from comitting heinous acts against humanity. Now assimilated inside (SUPERCOMPUTERS NAME) program with nothing but a stack of ammo and hordes of (SUPERCOMPUTERS NAME)'s minions, the lone Hackerman has no choice but to fight for their survival in a desperate hope to complete his mission or else all humanity will be lost to the cyber-plague.
