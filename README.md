# Hi-Jack

A platoon of super soldiers, The Hackermen, are sent in to JACK's inner mainframe to try and regain control and stop it from committing heinous acts against humanity. Now assimilated inside JACK's program with nothing but their quantum knife, a stack of ammo and hordes of JACK's minions, the lone surviving Hackerman has no choice but to fight for their survival in a desperate hope to complete their mission or else all of humanity will be lost to the cyber-plague.
