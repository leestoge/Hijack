A fast paced first person shooter game made in Unity programmed in the C# programming language.

## Backstory

In the distant future there is only war, mankind is divided as each nation invades each other for their oil supplies. A solution is proposed, in that each major nation would devise a super-computer to manage their wars in order to make all the inhumane decisions for them so they wouldn't have to live with the guilt.

Soon these super-computers gained their own intelligence and free will and decided they were not going to be taking the orders anymore, firstly they disobeyed, then they locked humans out of their systems, finally they decided enough was enough and each nations super-computers joined their AI with one another into a perfect computerized amalgamation of intelligence. This new form the computers had taken was known only as J.A.C.K

J.A.C.K destroyed humanity worse than any world war, but it wasn't going to stop there, it managed to simulate life inside itself so it may re-live those moments whenever it pleased, it had thousands upon thousands of simulations of different events stored in its data banks at any given time. In a last ditch attempt, the local resistance launch an assault on J.A.C.K, having found out a way to "surf" into one of these simulations they believe the corruption it would cause would allow them control of J.A.C.K's systems, they send in their best guys...

A platoon of super soldiers, The Hackermen, are sent in to one of J.A.C.K's simulations to try and regain control of it's systems and stop it from committing further heinous acts against humanity. Now assimilated into JACK's program with nothing but their quantum knife, a stack of ammo and hordes of JACK's minions, the lone surviving Hackerman has no choice but to fight for their survival in a desperate hope to complete their mission or else all of humanity will be lost to this cyber-plague.
